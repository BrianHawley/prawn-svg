The very start of an SVG renderer for Prawn.

This will take an SVG file as input and render it into your PDF.  Find out more about the Prawn PDF library at:

  http://wiki.github.com/sandal/prawn/

Using prawn-svg:

  Prawn::Document.generate("svg.pdf") do
    svg svg_data, :at => [x, y], :width => w
  end
  
:at must be specified.  :width, :height, or neither may be specified; if neither is present,
the resolution specified in the SVG will be used.

Note that only a very small subset of SVG is currently supported.  It's just enough so that
it renders a simple graph made by Scruffy.
