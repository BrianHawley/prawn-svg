The very start of an SVG renderer for Prawn.

This will take an SVG file as input and render it into your PDF.

Usage:

  pdf.svg svg_data, :at => [x, y], :width => w
  
:at must be specified.  :width, :height, or neither may be specified; if neither is present,
the resolution specified in the SVG will be used.

Note that only a very small subset of SVG is currently supported; it's just enough so that
it renders a simple graph made by Scruffy.
