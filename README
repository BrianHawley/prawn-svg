An SVG renderer for the Prawn PDF library.

This will take an SVG file as input and render it into your PDF.  Find out more about the Prawn PDF library at:

Using prawn-svg:

  Prawn::Document.generate("svg.pdf") do
    svg svg_data, :at => [x, y], :width => w
  end
  
:at must be specified.  :width, :height, or neither may be specified; if neither is present,
the resolution specified in the SVG will be used.

prawn-svg is in its infancy and does not support the full SVG specifications.  It currently supports:

- line tag
- polyline tag
- polygon tag
- circle tag
- ellipse tag (although this seems to be buggy)

- rect tag
  supports rounded rects, but only one radius is applied to all corners

- path tag
  supports moveto, closepath, lineto, horiz lineto, vert lineto, curveto, smooth curveto, quad curveto, smooth quad curveto
  does not support elliptical arc

- text tag
  attributes: size, text-anchor
  partially supported attributes: font-family
  
- attributes/styles: fill, stroke, stroke-width, opacity, fill-opacity, stroke-opacity, transform

- transform methods: translate, rotate, scale

- colors: html standard names, #xxx, #xxxxxx, rgb(1, 2, 3), rgb(1%, 2%, 3%)

prawn-svg does NOT support CSS classes, named elements, anything in the defs tag, the tspan tag, gradients/patterns or markers.
